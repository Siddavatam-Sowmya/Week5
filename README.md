Weather App
Hello Everyone,

I’m excited to introduce my Weather App, developed as part of my ongoing journey with Prodigy Infotech. This application, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides real-time weather updates for any location. Users can search for their city to get detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, and conditions.

This project was an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills in API integration and responsive web design, ensuring the app is both functional and user-friendly. I’m eager to keep pushing the boundaries of my development skills with more exciting projects!
